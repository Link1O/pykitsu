This is an asynchronous and high-speed Python API wrapper for accessing Kitsu.io API.

## Features

- **Asynchronous**: Utilizes asyncio to perform non-blocking operations, making it efficient for handling multiple requests concurrently.

- **Speed Optimized**: Built to provide fast response times by leveraging efficient HTTP requests.

- **rate limit handled**: comes with a built in rate limit manager.

- **easy to learn**: by simplifying the syntax the library can be really easy to grasp.

## Notes
